# Python - Import & Modules

## Project Overview

This project focuses on understanding and utilizing modules in Python. Through various tasks, I explored how to import functions from different files, create their own modules, and use command line arguments effectively. The exercises are designed to enhance familiarity with Pythonâ€™s import system, code organization, and proper coding standards.

## Learning Objectives

- The significance of Python programming.
- How to import functions from another file.
- The usage of imported functions.
- How to create a module.
- The function `dir()` and its applications.
- How to prevent code in your script from executing upon import.
- Utilizing command line arguments in Python programs.



## Tasks Overview

1. **Import a simple function from a simple file**:
   - Write a program that imports the `add` function from `add_0.py` and prints the result of adding `1 + 2`.

2. **My first toolbox!**:
   - Create a program that imports functions from `calculator_1.py`, performs basic math operations, and prints the results.

3. **How to make a script dynamic!**:
   - Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed and lists them.

4. **Infinite addition**:
   - Create a program that sums all command-line arguments and prints the result.

5. **Who are you?**:
   - Write a program that prints names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`, excluding names that start with `__`.

6. **Everything can be imported**:
   - Import the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py` and print its value.

7. **Build my own calculator!**:
   - Write a calculator program that imports all functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs operations based on user input.

8. **Easy print**:
   - Write a program that prints `#pythoniscool`, with restrictions on allowed functions.

9. **ByteCode -> Python #3**:
   - Implement the function `magic_calculation(a, b)` which mimics specific Python bytecode behavior.

10. **Fast alphabet**:
    - Write a program that prints the alphabet in uppercase without using loops or conditional statements.
