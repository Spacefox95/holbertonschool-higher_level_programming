# Python - Everything is Object

## Description
This project delves into the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming in Python, exploring the concept that "everything is an object." It covers the differences between classes and objects, immutability and mutability, references, and how Python manages memory. Through a series of tasks, this project illustrates essential concepts such as how to check object identity, manipulate variables, and understand how Python handles mutable and immutable types. By completing this project, I will gain a deeper understanding of how Python treats objects and the implications of these characteristics for effective programming.

## General Topics Covered
- What is an object?
- Differences between a class and an object/instance.
- Immutable vs. mutable objects.
- Understanding references, assignments, and aliases.
- Identifying identical variables and memory addresses.
- Built-in mutable and immutable types.
- How Python passes variables to functions.

## Tasks Overview
1. **Who am I?** - Determine the function to print the type of an object.
2. **Where are you?** - Retrieve the variable identifier in CPython.
3. **Right count** - Analyze object identity with integer assignments.
4. **Is equal** - Explore equality with strings and lists.
5. **List append** - Understand how list modifications affect references.
6. **Tuple identification** - Identify tuples and their properties.
7. **Copying lists** - Implement a function to copy a list object.
8. **Understanding memory management** - Explore Python's handling of mutable and immutable types in functions.
...

This project is designed to strengthen your understanding of Python's object model and enhance your programming skills through practical tasks and examples.
