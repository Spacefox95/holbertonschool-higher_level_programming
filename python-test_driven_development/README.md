# Python Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Project Overview

This project is placed on understanding and applying Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. The aim is to write comprehensive tests for each function before implementation, ensuring robust and reliable code. The project consists of multiple tasks, each designed to reinforce TDD principles through practical coding challenges. 

## Background Context

In this project, I learned to prioritize documentation and testing by writing tests and docstrings before I start coding. Collaboration on test cases is encouraged to cover all scenarios, but the implementation of the code was individual.

## Learning Objectives

- Explain the importance of Python programming and TDD.
- Understand interactive tests and their significance.
- Write comprehensive docstrings for modules and functions.
- Create tests for your code using Python's `doctest` and `unittest` modules.
- Identify and handle edge cases effectively.

## Requirement

### Python Test Cases

- Test files should be located in a `tests` directory and have a `.txt` or `.py` extension.
- Use `doctest` for tests in `.txt` files and `unittest` for `.py` files.
- All tests must pass with the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*` or `python3 -m unittest tests.<test_file>`.

## Tasks

1. **Integers Addition**: Write a function that adds two integers.
2. **Divide a Matrix**: Create a function that divides all elements of a matrix by a specified divisor.
3. **Say My Name**: Implement a function that prints a formatted string with a first and last name.
4. **Print Square**: Develop a function that prints a square made of `#` characters.
5. **Text Indentation**: Write a function to format text with specific indentation rules.
6. **Max Integer - Unittest**: Create unittests for a function that returns the maximum integer from a list.
