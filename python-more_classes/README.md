# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description

This project explores the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It covers essential concepts such as classes, objects, attributes, and methods, providing a thorough understanding of how to define and use these elements effectively. By delving into topics like data abstraction, encapsulation, and the special methods in Python, this project serves as a practical guide for both beginners and experienced programmers looking to deepen their knowledge of OOP in Python. 

The project includes a series of tasks that incrementally build a `Rectangle` class, demonstrating various OOP concepts and best practices in Python. Each task enhances the `Rectangle` class with new functionalities, from basic property management to advanced representation and comparison methods.

## Topics Covered

- Introduction to Python and its OOP features
- Explanation of classes, objects, instances, and attributes
- Understanding public, protected, and private attributes
- Use of the `self` keyword
- Methods and the special `__init__` method
- Data abstraction, encapsulation, and information hiding
- Properties and the difference between attributes and properties
- Pythonic ways to write getters and setters
- Special methods like `__str__` and `__repr__`
- Class and static methods
- Dynamic attribute creation
- Utilizing `getattr` for attribute access

## Tasks Overview

1. **Simple rectangle**: Define an empty class `Rectangle`.
2. **Real definition of a rectangle**: Implement private instance attributes for width and height with proper validation.
3. **Area and Perimeter**: Add methods to calculate the area and perimeter of the rectangle.
4. **String representation**: Implement string representations using `print()` and `str()`.
5. **Eval is magic**: Enable `repr()` to allow recreation of the instance using `eval()`.
6. **Detect instance deletion**: Print a message upon instance deletion.
7. **How many instances**: Track the number of instances created and deleted.
8. **Change representation**: Allow customization of the print symbol for the rectangle representation.
9. **Compare rectangles**: Implement comparison methods to find the larger rectangle based on area.
10. **A square is a rectangle**: Introduce a method to create a square instance from the rectangle class.
