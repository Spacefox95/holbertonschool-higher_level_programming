# Holberton School Higher Level Programming

![image info](./Python-logo-notext.svg.png)

## Description

This repository is dedicated to learn Python. It includes an apprenticeship of Object-Oriented Programming. It also include an introduction to database management in SQL. I learned to use SQLAlchemy in order to communicate between Python and SQL databases.
The learning course started with Python basics function (def, print...) in order to compare it with my C skills. Then, OOP and my first classes
declarations and definitions. It finishes with SQL and SQLAlchemy that are necessary knwowledge for a fullstack developer.

## Challenges

After month of learning and practicing C langage, starting a new langage (Python) was a nice continuation. Python looked so easy compared to C at first place. But the introduction of OOP wasn't that natural, and especially my first implementation of classes.
Also, SQL with tables and queries was a lot of information to learn and remenber. I admit that joints aren't very clear in my mind yet, but practicing more and more should improve my understanding.
