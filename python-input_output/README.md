# Python - Input/Output

## Description

This project aims to explore fundamental file handling and JSON serialization/deserialization techniques in Python. Through a series of practical tasks, it covers various aspects of reading from and writing to files, managing file contexts with the `with` statement, and performing operations with JSON data. I learned how to create, append, and read files while ensuring proper file closure. Additionally, I dived into the concepts of serialization and deserialization, enabling seamless conversion between Python data structures and JSON strings. The project culminates with tasks that involve building classes, managing object attributes, and implementing functionality to save and load JSON representations of objects. This hands-on approach will solidify your understanding of Python's input/output capabilities, making it an essential resource for both beginners and those looking to refresh their skills in file handling and data manipulation.

## General Topics Covered

- Why Python programming is awesome
- File handling techniques
  - Opening files
  - Writing text to files
  - Reading file content (full and line by line)
  - Moving the cursor in a file
  - Ensuring files are closed after use
  - Using the `with` statement
- JSON fundamentals
  - What JSON is and its usage
  - Serialization and deserialization processes
  - Converting Python data structures to JSON strings and vice versa
- Accessing command line parameters in Python scripts

## Tasks Overview

1. **Read File**: Implement a function to read a UTF-8 text file and print its contents to standard output.
2. **Write to a File**: Create a function that writes a string to a text file, returning the number of characters written.
3. **Append to a File**: Write a function to append a string at the end of a UTF-8 text file and return the number of characters added.
4. **To JSON String**: Develop a function to return the JSON representation of an object.
5. **From JSON String to Object**: Implement a function that converts a JSON string back into a Python data structure.
6. **Save Object to a File**: Write a function that saves a Python object to a text file in JSON format.
7. **Create Object from a JSON File**: Create an object from a JSON file using a defined function.
8. **Load, Add, Save**: Write a script that gathers command line arguments, stores them in a list, and saves them to a JSON file.
9. **Class to JSON**: Implement a function that returns the dictionary representation of an object's attributes for JSON serialization.
10. **Student to JSON**: Create a `Student` class that includes methods for JSON serialization.
11. **Student to JSON with Filter**: Enhance the `Student` class to selectively serialize attributes based on input parameters.
12. **Student to Disk and Reload**: Add functionality to the `Student` class to reload attributes from a JSON dictionary.
13. **Pascal's Triangle**: Develop a function to generate Pascalâ€™s triangle given an integer input.

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to mastering input/output operations in Python, providing both theoretical understanding and practical applications.
