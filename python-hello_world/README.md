# Python - Hello, World

## Description
Welcome to the **Python - Hello, World** project! This project serves as an introductory exercise for novices in Python programming. It focuses on fundamental concepts such as using the Python interpreter, printing text and variables, working with strings, and understanding basic Python syntax and style guides. Through a series of engaging tasks, I learned how to implement various Python functionalities, ranging from simple print statements to string manipulation, all while adhering to coding standards like PEP8.

## Concepts
This project emphasizes the following key concepts:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Effective use of the print function
- Understanding strings, indexing, and slicing
- Familiarity with Python's official coding style, including the use of `pycodestyle`


## Learning Objectives

- Use the Python interpreter effectively.
- Print text and variables using the `print` function.
- Understand and manipulate strings.
- Utilize indexing and slicing in Python.
- Explain the official Python coding style and verify your code with `pycodestyle`.

## Requirements
- Python scripts should be written in Python 3 (version 3.8.*).
- All scripts must be executable and end with a new line.
- The first line of all scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository and within the project folder is mandatory.
- Ensure your code adheres to `pycodestyle` standards (version 2.7.*).

## Tasks
This project includes the following tasks:
1. **Hello, print**: Print a specific string.
2. **Print integer**: Print an integer stored in a variable.
3. **Print float**: Print a float with precision.
4. **Print string**: Print a string multiple times followed by its first 9 characters.
5. **Play with strings**: Concatenate and print strings using specific variables.
6. **Copy - Cut - Paste**: Manipulate string variables to extract parts of a string.
7. **Create a new sentence**: Print a specific sentence using variable values.
8. **Easter Egg**: Print "The Zen of Python" in a concise format.
